The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective
 and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and 
 build high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimize project 
 risks through forward planning so that software meets
 customer expectations during production and beyond.


 The practice of DevOps encourages smoother, continuous 
 communication, collaboration, integration, visibility, and 
 transparency between application development teams (Dev) 
 and their IT operations team (Ops) counterparts.
